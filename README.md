# Garcia_119502_Project01_Simon

This game is a recreation of the old Simon game where you have to remember the colors you are shown. The program is built to close if you get 1 wrong which is where you lose. 

The algorithm is made to randomly choose and display 1 of 4 colors evenly, and the number of colors increases with each round, theoratically, infinitely.
